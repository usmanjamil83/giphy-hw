# giphy-hw (GIPHY API work)

Overview

In this assignment, i will use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of tv shows.
for this task, i will call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.

Instructions

first i need to create an array of strings with the names of tv showes.
second app will take the topics from the array and will create buttons in the HTML.
i used the for loop that appends a button for each string in the array.
When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate, and If the user clicks the gif again, it will stop playing.
